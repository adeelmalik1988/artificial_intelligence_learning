Deep Learning Working

Y = WX + B

Y = output
X = Input
W = Coefficient
B = Interception

Types

AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) and ANI(Artificial Narrow Intelligence)

Probablistic Modeling --> Naive Bayes Algo

Decision Trees
Random Forest
Boosting Machines

CART (Classification Regression Tree)


Data convertion into number --> Vectorization

Vectorized Data is used to train Neural network

Classes and Labels

Break datasets column wise
1st part of Data --> Input 
Label --> output

Break data row wise can be divided into 02 or max 03 parts
Test data
Train Data
Validation Data
